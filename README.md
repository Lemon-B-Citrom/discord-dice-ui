# Discord Dice UI

> They are plenty of Discord bots that allow you to roll dice in the chat. They're may by great, but I never felt like typing while playing an RPG game. So I created this connector in which you can just select and click a die you want to roll on Discord's chat.

The app is intended to use as a graphical interface dice roller for Discord. You can connect it with your Discord's server and use to roll some dice! ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²
>
 You can modify how the result is displayed by selecting different _Roll Options_:
- Keep highest
- Keep lowest
- Sum results
- Add modifier
- Call of Cthulhu 7e Mode (read below)

**Never share your Webhook link publicly and keep it a secret. You don't want to allow strangers to publish messages in your chat.**  
ðŸ›‘ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸ›‘  

5. Every user has to enter the provided Webhook link url in the Settings modal inside the app. Entering the username is required as well.
